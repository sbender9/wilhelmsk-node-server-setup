Examples and Instructions to setup signalk-node-server to support all of the WilhelmSK features


First you'll  want to make sure you have the latest and greatest [signalk-server-node](https://github.com/SignalK/signalk-server-node) installed. Please see instructions there for initial install.


Next install the node server plugins that you want. Go to <http://localhost:3000/appstore> and install:

```
signalk-raymarine-autopilot
signalk-fusion-stereo
signalk-push-notifications
signalk-alarm-silencer
signalk-wilhelmsk-plugin
```

Now restart your server and go to <http://localhost:3000/plugins/configure>.
Activate the "Edit Zones", "Push Notifications", "Raymarine Autopilot", "Alarm Silencer", "Fusion Stereo" and "WilhelmSK" plugins.

For the autopilot and fusion plugins, you need to find the N2K device ids for those devices.
Hit the rest api for your server at <http://localhost:3000/signalk/v1/api/vessels/self>. You can do this in a browser, using curl or by looking at the "Log" in WilhelmSK.

You're looking for a piece of data in SignalK that comes from the device. For example, I know that pitch, raw and roll come from the Raymarine Course Computer:

```
  "navigation": {
    "attitude": {
      "$source": "actisense.204", 
      "pgn": 127257, 
      "pitch": 0.0219, 
      "roll": 0.0328, 
      "timestamp": "2016-11-15T19:59:59.891Z", 
      "yaw": 2.0521
    }, 
```

It's the '"$source": "actisense.204"' entry that's important. In this case, the device id is 204. Enter this for "Autopilot N2K Device ID" in the plugin configuration screen and hit Submit.

#Optionally install the anchor alarm plugin via the app store:

```
signalk-anchoralarm-plugin
```
